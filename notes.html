Create an app to display the Quiz grades of each penguin for a particular day in a scatterplot. By default, the app should present the grades of each pengin on day one. Have buttons (or things that act like buttons) for the user to click on in order to switch the view to another day. You will want to remove all circles before you redraw your graph.

For something extra, create two additional buttons called next and prev. Clicking these will move you on to the next (or previous) day of quiz grades. Here is the catch, you should do this without global variables. Reassign the .on() to the buttons each time a button is pressed.
